<h2>Newest Examples</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://luciencode-salesdashboard.netlify.app" class="link small_link" target="blank">Sales Dashboard: <strong>(Now with useReducer!)</strong>
My first app made in React and a little bit of bootstrap as I continue to improve. It calculates an hourly wage, commission rate, the number of hours worked and calculates totals. You can also add sales objects that add to your total via the commission rate while also calculating the amount of the commission if you had to share the spoils with another salesperson.</a></li>

<p>I've spent some time away but the journey back has been a challenging yet fun and rewarding path that I'll continue to walk and I look forward to doing so as part of a team where I'm sure my skills and confidence will then grow exponentially once I get started in full-time role.</p>`;
