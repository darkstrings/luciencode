    <p class="top-p"><strong>Some of these apps rely on free subscrptions of MongoDB, render.com and netlify. I give them activity weekly so that they don't get put into a sleep state but things can always change. A few may need 30 seconds to "spin up" if there's been inactivity for more than 15-30 minutes. It's not a glitch but merely a one time delay as that service wakes up if it's been inactive.</strong></p>

You can also add sales objects that add to your total via the commission rate while also calculating the amount of the commission if you had to share the spoils with another salesperson.</li>
